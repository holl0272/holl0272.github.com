<H4>General Operation</H4>
<OL>
  <LI>Once a customer places an order there are two steps 
  that must be performed, collecting payment and filling their order. Order 
  Manager helps you keep track of&nbsp; both these steps. As soon as an order is 
  placed an entry will appear in the order status summary. You can narrow down 
  the results through the use of the filter. 
  <LI>When you receive payments you can either record the 
  payments indivually through the order detail section or en masse using the 
  quick payment screen. 
  <LI>When you ship the orders you can either record the 
  orders individually through the order detail section or en masse using the 
  quick shipment screen. In conjunction with recording an order as shipped you 
  can optionally send a fulfillment email to your customer. 
  <LI>If you use an external shipping program you can import the shipping 
  information via use of the Shipping Import Screen.</LI></OL>

buttons at the top of the filter section.</p>

  orders at one time. Double clicking the payment date box will automatically
