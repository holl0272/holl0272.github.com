<h2>Promotional Mail Manager for StoreFront 5.0</h2>
<p>Promotional Mail Manager permits you to easily select specific customers or
potential customers and send them promotional mailings through your Microsoft Internet Explorer browser. This is accomplished
by calling the file PromoMailAdmin.asp from you browser.</p>
<h4>To create a promotional mailing follow these three steps:</h4>
<p>1.&nbsp; Narrow your customer search by specifying the parameters unique to
the promotional mailing.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Select the addresses you wish to send the email to.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Create you email and press send.</p>
<h4>Filtering your potential mailing list</h4>
<p>You may filter your customers (or potential customers) based on the following
parameters:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Orders containing specific products - separate the products with
    semicolons (;)</li>
  <li>Orders placed within a specific date range
    <ul>
      <li>Start Date - If selected, only orders placed on or AFTER this date
        will be returned</li>
      <li>End Date - If selected, only orders placed on or BEFORE this date will
        be returned</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Customers with order totals between specific amounts
    <ul>
      <li>First Amount - If selected, only orders greater than this amount will
        be returned</li>
      <li>Second Amount- If selected, only orders less than this amount will be
        returned</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Customers who ordered products from specific manufacturers, vendors, or
    categories</li>
  <li>Show customers who are subscribed as well as those are not</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the parameters (order date and amount) can be selected by a range.
You may fill out either, both, or neither.</p>
<p>Note: If you select any parameter other than Subscribed Customers, visitors
who have signed up for you mailing list but who have not ordered anything will
not appear on the list</p>
<h4>Selecting addresses</h4>
<p>As soon as you call the page, all potential mailing addresses are loaded. You
may narrow down the list by setting the parameters described above. You may also
narrow down the result set by individually checking the customer's name using
the checkbox. By default, they are all unchecked to prevent accidental mailings.
A button is provided to check (or uncheck) all names.</p>
<h4>Creating the email</h4>
<p>From (email address): - This is your email address. It is automatically
populated based on your primary email address for your store. This may be
changed.</p>
<p>From (display name): - This is the display name for your &quot;From&quot;
line in the email. This is not supported by all email methods. It is
automatically populated based on your primary email address. This may be
changed.</p>
<p>Subject: You may insert replacement codes in this field</p>
<p>Body: This may be either html or plain text and may include the replacement
codes. Alternatively, you may use the Browse button to pull a previously created
message. (Note: This feature requires you to modify your default script security
settings in your browser.) Not all email methods support this.</p>
<h4>Replacement Codes:</h4>
<p>This add-on will automatically substitute specific &quot;replacement
codes&quot; so you can customize your message. These are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;customerFirstName&gt; - Inserts the customer's first name</li>
  <li>&lt;customerLastName&gt; -&nbsp; Inserts the customer's last name</li>
  <li>&lt;customerName&gt; -&nbsp; Inserts the customer's first and last name
    separated with a single space</li>
  <li>&lt;unsubscribeLink&gt; -&nbsp; Inserts a link to return to your site and
    unsubscribe. In html mode, the link is merely the word &quot;here&quot;
    linking back to your site</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note, in html mode, the replacement codes are automatically adjusted
based on &lt; and &gt; being special characters. You may type the codes as you
see directly in your editor. </p>
<h4>How to enable your Internet Explorer browser to use the Browse button</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Open PromoMailAdmin.asp in your browser</li>
  <li>From the menu select&nbsp; Tools --&gt; Options</li>
  <li>Select the Security tab</li>
  <li>Press the Custom Level button</li>
  <li>Find the &quot;Initialize and script ActiveX controls not marked as safe&quot;
    option</li>
  <li>Set this value to Enable or Prompt (I recommend Prompt, it can be
    annoying, but it is the safest)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Managing you mail list</h4>
<p>You may manually subscribe or unsubscribe customers from you mailing list. To
do so</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Narrow your customer search by specifying the parameters unique to
the promotional mailing.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Select the addresses you wish to change the status of</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Press either the subscribe or unsubscribe buttons</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
