<H3>User's Guide for <A 
href="http://www.sandshot.net/">Sandshot Software's</A> Postage Rate Component</H3>
<P><a href="#Usage">Configuration</a><BR><A href="#Custom">Customization</A></P>
<P>  The Postage Rate Component  obtains real time rate information 
from FedEx, Freight Quote, United Parcel Service, and the United States Postal Service. 
It is highly configurable to estimate your customers' order shipping costs. Each 
individual shipping method can be configured to adjust the returned rate based 
on a variety of features.</P>
<P>  &nbsp;As 
an additional feature, insurance rates can be obtained based upon the declared 
value. However, the insurance rates from UPS and U.S.P.S. themselves are NOT real 
time. The insurance rates presented are based upon Domestic Insurance rates in 
effect as of January 28, 2001. The insurance rate from FedEx is calculated 
real time. </P>
<P>The file CarrierAdmin.asp allows you to edit your shipping methods. Please 
note that for the real-time rates to work, the shipCode field must NOT be 
altered. You may change the name however.</P>
<H3><a name="Usage">Configuration</a></H3>
<p>Each shipping method must be identified to a carrier. Each shipping method 
contains a variety of features which permit you to customize each method to meet 
your needs.</p>
<h4>Shipping Methods</h4>
<ul>
  <li>checkbox - this identifies which methods are to be 
  updated or deleted 
  <li><b>Shipping Methods</b>
  <ul>
  <li><i>Name</i> - this is the name 
    that appears in your site 
 
  <li><i>Code</i> - this is a unique 
    code as required by the carrier 
 
  <li><i>Carrier</i> - the carrier this method is unique to. You can administer 
  your carrier list via <a href="../ssshippingMethodsAdmin.asp">
  ssshippingMethodsAdmin.asp</a>
  <li><i>Enabled</i> - check if you want it to be available for your customers</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Shipping Charges</b>
  <ul>
  <li><i>Min</i> - this sets the 
    minimum charge for the methods' rate and is used if the carrier returns a 
    rate less than this amount 
 
  <li><i>Mult</i>. - this is used to 
    multiply the rate returned by the carrier. It will also apply to the minimum 
    charge if used 
 
  <li><i>Pkg Fee</i> - this is a per 
    package fee assessed on each box being shipped. You may have more than one 
    box if the "super package" exceeds identified limits 
 
  <li><i>Ship Fee</i> - this is a per shipment fee and is only applied once, no 
  matter how many boxes are created</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Free Shipping</b>
  <ul>
  <li><i>Amount</i> - this identifies 
    the order amount which qualifies for this method to have free shipping. 
 
  <li><i>Max Wt </i>- if the order weight exceeds this amount, free shipping 
  will not be applied</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Order Restrictions</b>
  <ul>
  <li><i>Min Wt</i> - the minimum 
    order weight before this shipping method appears as a choice. It is 
    primarily used for freight 
 
  <li><i>Max Wt</i> - the maximum an order can weigh and still show this 
  shipping method as a choice. It is also used to break down a "super package"</li>
  </ul>
  <li><b>Package Restrictions</b>
  <ul>
  <li><i>Pref Wt</i> - the weight you 
    prefer to have the "super package" broken down by. This value is useful 
    because some carriers start charging excessively for heavier packages. 
    Example. If an order weighs 70 lbs, it may be cheaper to send it as two 35 
    lb packages than one 70 lb package. If you set the preferred weight to 35 
    lbs and the max weight to 70 lbs, as long as no individual item weighs more 
    than 35 lbs the calculator will estimate the order based on two 35 lb 
    packages. 
 
  <li><i>Max Girth</i> - if you have larger, light items it is possible to 
  exceed the carriers' max package dimensions while still meeting their absolute 
  weight limit. This value permits you to handle this situation.</li>
</ul>
  <li><b>Default</b> - select the shipping method you wish to be selected in the 
  dropdown</li></ul>
<p>You can manually arrange the display order of the shipping methods by 
selecting the desired shipping method and moving it up or down the list with the 
<input style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size :11px; font-weight :bold; background:steelblue; color :azure; cursor:hand;" id="btnMoveUp" name="btnMoveUp" type="button" value="Move Up"> and <input style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size :11px; font-weight :bold; background:steelblue; color :azure; cursor:hand;" id="Button1" name="btnMoveDown" type="button" value="Move Down"> buttons.</p>
<p>You can delete a shipping method by checking the shipping methods you no 
longer wish and pressing the <input style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size :11px; font-weight :bold; background:steelblue; color :azure; cursor:hand;" id="btnDelete" name="btnDelete" type="button" value="Delete"> button.</p>
<p>You can add a shipping method by pressing the <input style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size :11px; font-weight :bold; background:steelblue; color :azure; cursor:hand;" id="btnAdd" name="btnAdd" type="button" value="Add"> button</p>
<p>You can save your changes by pressing the <input style="font-family:Tahoma; font-size :11px; font-weight :bold; background:steelblue; color :azure; cursor:hand;" id="btnUpdate" name="btnUpdate" type="button" value="Update"> button. Only those methods 
checked will be updated. This does not apply to the default and method ordering 
which are update regardless of which boxes are checked.</p>
<h4>Carriers</h4>
<ul>
  <li><i>Carrier Name</i> - self 
  explanatory 
  <li><i>Username</i> - some carriers 
  require a username to access their site 
  <li><i>Password</i> - some carriers require a password to access their site</li>
</ul>
<p>Rate calculation. The order item are automatically loaded to identify the 
individual items in the order and their respective sizes. If there are multiple 
items in the order they are combined into a "super package" which simply creates 
a package by summing the package heights and using the maximum length and width. 
The weights are themselves summed. The "super package" is then compared against 
the maximum weight and maximum dimensions permitted for the shipping method. If 
these maximums are exceeded, the "super package" is divided into smaller 
packages. This division will be based upon the maximum item weight and the 
preferred weight. If no individual item weighs more than the preferred weight, 
the package will be divided by the preferred weight. A package cannot be created 
which is smaller than the maximum item weight nor the largest individual 
dimension. The rate is then determined by submitting the resulting package to 
the carrier for rating. The carrier will return a rate which is the basis for 
the shipping method calculation as follows:</p>
<p>Shipping Charge = Number of Packages x ((Multiple x Rate) + per Package Fee) 
+ Shipment Fee<br>
where the rate is returned is the rate returned by the carrier or the minimum 
charge for that shipping method, whichever is greater.</p>
