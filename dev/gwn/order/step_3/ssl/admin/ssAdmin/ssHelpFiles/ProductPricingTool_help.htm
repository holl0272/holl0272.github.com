<H2> Product Pricing Tool User's Guide for StoreFront 5.0</H2>

This page allows you to add/edit/delete your inventory. 
It has the added feature of allowing you to create new products including the 
attribute at one time along with editing the same. You can also duplicate an 
entire product including its attributes with the push of one button or just 
duplicate an attribute category within the product. This page also contains 
advanced search capabilities to narrow down your product list.
<h4>Step 1.&nbsp; Narrow your product listing with the filter</h4>
<P>This section allows you to filter the product summary section by Product ID, 
short description, long description, and the Product name. You may choose not to 
filter on these items by selecting do not include.</P>
<P>You may also filter by product prices. By filling in the top input only, you 
may filter out products priced less than the entered amount. By filling in the 
bottom input only, you will filter out all prices greater than the entered 
amount. Entering values for both will produce products priced between the two 
values.</P>
<P>You may also filter on category, manufacturer, vendor, and by if the product 
is active, inactive, or both. If you are using the Advanced Edition of 
StoreFront, multiple categories can be selected at one time for the filter. 
Below the selection are &quot;<i>And</i>&quot; an &quot;<i>Or</i>&quot; radio buttons. Since the 
Advanced Edition supports assigning products to multiple categories you can 
select products which are in any of the categories selected by using the &quot;<i>Or</i>&quot; 
option or products which are in all the categories selected by using the &quot;<i>And</i>&quot; 
option.</P>
<h4>Step 2.&nbsp; Make your pricing changes</h4>
<P>You can either manually set the prices by entering them directly in the 
fields or by using the automated scripts described below.</P>
<P><i>Adjust Regular Prices</i></P>
<P>You can increase or prices by a set amount or percentage based on the 
existing price in the regular price field. The increase can be either a fixed 
amount or a percentage increase. You may optionally force the price to end in a 
fixed amount, for example, .99.</P>
<P><i>Adjust Sale Prices</i></P>
<P>You can increase or prices by a set amount or percentage based on the 
existing price in either the regular price field or in the existing sale price 
field. The increase can be either a fixed amount or a percentage increase. You 
may optionally force the price to end in a fixed amount, for example, .99.</P>
<P><i>Adjust Attribute Pricing</i></P>
<P>You can increase or prices by a set amount or percentage based on the 
existing price in either the regular price field or in the existing attribute 
price field. The increase can be either a fixed amount or a percentage increase. 
You may optionally force the price to end in a fixed amount, for example, .99.</P>
<h4>Step 3. Save your pricing changes</h4>
<p>Next to each field is a checkbox. Only those rows with the checkbox checked 
will have the information updated in the database. For your convenience, <i>
Check All</i> and <i>Uncheck All</i> buttons have been provided. When you are 
satisfied with your changes, simply press the <i>Save Changes</i> button.</p>


<H3>Advanced Configuration</H3>
<P>The top of ssProductPricingTool.asp contains a user parameters section. This 
section contains parameters which can optimize your data access time and is 
especially important for large databases. If you find the page times out 
regularly you can increase the time allotted for loading the page by changing 
the following parameter.</P>
<UL>
<li>Server.ScriptTimeout - by default this is set to 90	seconds. Larger databases may need to up this value is the page times out frequently
