<h4>Usage</H4>
<P>The WebStore Manager Gold component for StoreFront 5 
permits you to manage your StoreFront 5 website through the Microsoft Internet 
Explorer Browser (some functions will work with a Netscape browser but it is not 
pretty.)&nbsp; The starting point to administer&nbsp;your Web Store is admin.asp. This page links to all aspects of your website administration, be it 
store appearance, support settings, product administration, or sales 
administration. Most pages are self-explanatory but the following pages have 
features that you should understand.</P>
<h4>Overall Apperance</H4>
<P>The overall appearance of the WebStore Manager is 
controlled in the AdminHeader.asp file. The color schemes can be altered in the 
CSS section. You can also change the navigational structure and gasp!, remove 
the Sandshot Software image if you so desire. If you edit this file, do not edit 
it in design mode of your favorite editor. It will likely add additional HTML 
markup.</P>
<P>On some pages user selected&nbsp; images act as buttons 
and reflect the actual image size. While for larger images it "dirties up" the 
clean layout, it was decided it was better to allow you to see the actual image 
size. If the "No Image Selected" image appears, it simply means that no image is 
associated with that design attribute. If a broken image appears it means the 
image in the database is not in the web and should be corrected. To change the 
image simply click on the image. The relative URL will be automatically 
generated.</P>
<P>Several pages allow you to sort by column headers. These 
are readily&nbsp; identifiable by 1) an arrow showing the sort column/direction 
and 2) the cursor changes to a hand when passed over the column header.</P>
<H4>                
        Design Administration:</H4>
<P>This page allows to configure and maintain multiple 
design styles for your web store. The designs shown in this table are simply 
store designs and are not the designs the site uses. This means you may adjust 
the settings of any saved design without immediately affecting the actual web 
appearance as long as the design you are working on is not marked active. Once 
you a design that is checked active your design configuration will be written to 
the configuration file.&nbsp; The various design sections can be viewed by 
selecting the corresponding areas on the design table.&nbsp; Tip: You can play 
with the active design and save the changes without affecting the deployed 
design by deselecting the active box before you save the changes. The downside 
to this is the summary table will not show any active designs until you choose 
to commit the changes.</P>
<h4>Product Administration</H4>
<P>This page allows you to add/edit/delete your inventory. 
It has the added feature of allowing you to create new products including the 
attribute at one time along with editing the same. You can also duplicate an 
entire product including its attributes with the push of one button or just 
duplicate an attribute category within the product. This page also contains 
advanced search capabilities to narrow down your product list.</P>
<i>Advanced Configuration</I>
<P>The top of productadmin.asp contains a user parameters 
section. This section contains parameters which can optimize your data access 
time and is especially important for large databases containing many 
attributes.</P>
<ul>
<li>mblnIsSQL - by default this is set to false for an Access database - set to true for SQL Server
<li>Const mblnShowAttributes -	by default this is set to true to show attributes in summary table. Set this to false for faster page loading. Large databases with a lot of attributes should set this value to false.
<li>Const mblnAutoShowTable - by default this is set to true to automatically display the product summary on the 
initial page loading
<li>Server.ScriptTimeout - by default this is set to 90	seconds. Larger databases may need to up this value is the page times out frequently
<li>mlngMaxRecords - by default this is set to 25. This is 
  the default Maximum Records to show in summary table on the initial page 
  loading </LI></UL>
<h4>Category Maintenance</h4>
<p>This page allows you to add/edit/delete your categories. Note it contains 
more information than the standard StoreFront installation supports. The extra 
fields are not required, however, with some minor modification (and some major) 
you can customize your web to utilize these fields.</p>
<p>Option 1: Hide inactive categories from displaying in category list</p>
<ol>
  <li>Activating/Deactivating categories: open incSearchResult.asp</li>
  <li>Find: &quot;SELECT DISTINCT catID, catName FROM sfCategories Order By CatName&quot;</li>
  <li>Change to &quot;SELECT DISTINCT catID, catName FROM sfCategories Where 
  catIsActive=1 Order By CatName&quot;</li>
</ol>
<h4>Database Maintenance</H4>
<P>The default StoreFront global.asa contains code to 
"clean-up" the database every time somebody enters your web site. The problem is 
this is done every time somebody enters you web site when in reality this 
housekeeping activity needs only be run occasionally (how often depends on your 
web site's traffic.) The option to "Clean Up Database" has been provided to 
perform the housekeeping when you want and to the level of detail you 
desire.</P>
<P>You may also optionally compact and repair your Access 
database. If you do this, you may create a back-up copy of the database which 
will automatically be named the same as your current database with the date 
appended to the end. Note: If you create more than one back-up in the same day, 
the prior back-up(s) for that day will be overwritten.</P></FONT></body>
