                <p>
                  GameWearNow and its parent company, the Sports Spot, have been providing custom jerseys to schools, youth leagues, recreational leagues and professional teams for over 50 years.
                </p>
                  <br>
                <p>
                  We know you want custom jerseys...quick. We pride ourselves in the speed of our delivery and the quality of our work. GameWearNow has sold jerseys over the web since 1999. Our goal is to deliver you jerseys in about a week.
                </p>
                  <br>
                <p>
                  We also know that sometimes you don't have a week. At GameWearNow, we will do our best to meet your schedule, even if it means getting you a jersey overnights.  Just call our toll-free number (877) 776-6693 and we will do everything possible to get your jerseys to you when you need them.
                </p>
                  <br>
                <p>
                  Other companies require minimum orders...not GameWearNow.
                </p>
                  <br>
                <p>
                  Of course, GameWearnNow offers quantity discounts for team orders. We can fill your order no matter how large it might be...we've been earning the trust of our customers for a half-century.

                  Yes. We understand that, although ordering custom jerseys over the internet is convenient, it can be a confusing process. We've worked hard to streamline our order process and we hope this section answers any questions that you may have.

                <p>
                  Yes. Though we offer several lettering selections, we are happy to use your custom logo. There is a one-time set-up fee of $35. Be sure to e-mail us a .gif or .jpeg image your logo during the ordering process.

                  <br class="break">
                <p>
                  Lettering is typically applied via heat press. We have been lettering jerseys for decades. We know what we are doing and are confident that your lettering will remain in tact wash after wash after wash.
